      <h1>About Coastonia</h1>

      <p>
        Coastonia Technology Services is a consulting practice focused on the design, delivery,
        and operation of enterprise-scale billing platforms and cloud-native systems.
        We work with organizations that depend on reliable, secure, and cost-efficient platforms
        to support their core business.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work spans the full lifecycle of complex systems — from architecture and implementation
        through modernization, cloud operations, and continuous delivery.
        Coastonia brings hands-on experience across telecommunications, enterprise billing,
        and distributed cloud platforms.

      <h2>How We Work</h2>

      <p>
        Coastonia operates as a small, senior-led consulting practice.
        Engagements are intentionally focused and delivery-oriented, ensuring clients
        work directly with experienced practitioners rather than layered delivery teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        We collaborate closely with internal engineering, operations, and business teams,
        integrating seamlessly into existing environments while providing clear technical leadership
        and practical guidance.
      </p>
